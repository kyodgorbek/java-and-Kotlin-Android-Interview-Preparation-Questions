# 1. Four Principles of OOP
Question: What are the four principles of OOP?
# Answer:

The four principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

- Encapsulation: Hiding internal states and behaviors, only exposing a public interface.
Example: Private variables with public getters/setters.

- Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes relevant to the problem.
Example: Payment method interface with implementations like CreditCard, PayPal.

- Inheritance: Creating new classes by inheriting properties from existing ones.
Example: Dog inherits from Animal.

- Polymorphism: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
Example: A method can accept both Circle and Rectangle as they implement Shape.
