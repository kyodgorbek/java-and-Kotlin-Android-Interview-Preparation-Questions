# 1. Four Principles of OOP
Question: What are the four principles of OOP?
# Answer:

The four principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

- **Encapsulation:**
-  Hiding internal states and behaviors, only exposing a public interface.
- **Example:**
- Private variables with public getters/setters.

- Abstraction:
- Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes relevant to the problem.
- **Example:**
-  Payment method interface with implementations like CreditCard, PayPal.

- **Inheritance:**
- Creating new classes by inheriting properties from existing ones.
- **Example:**
-  Dog inherits from Animal.

- **Polymorphism:**
-  Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
  - **Example:**
- A method can accept both Circle and Rectangle as they implement Shape.


# 2. Difference Between an Interface and an Abstract Class in Java
# Question:
What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?

# Answer:

 - **Interface:**
 - All methods are abstract by default (Java 8+ allows default methods).
 - Can be implemented by multiple classes (supports multiple inheritance).

- **Abstract Class**
- Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
-  A class can only inherit from one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

 # 3. Purpose of val and var in Kotlin
 # Answer:
 - val: Declares an immutable variable, equivalent to final in Java.
- **Example:**
  ``` kotlin
  val name = "John"
    ```

- var: Declares a mutable variable that can be reassigned.
- **Example:**
 ``` kotlin
  var age = 30
    ```

# 4. Java Memory Management
# Question: 
 How does Java handle memory management?
# Answer:

- Java uses Garbage Collection (GC) to automatically manage memory.
- Unreferenced objects are removed from memory to prevent memory leaks.
- Java divides memory into Heap (for object storage) and Stack (for references).

 # 5. Kotlin Extension Functions
# Question:
What are Kotlin's extension functions?
# Answer:
Extension functions let you add functionality to existing classes without modifying their code.
``` kotlin
fun String.reverseText(): String {
    return this.reversed()
}

val original = "Hello"
println(original.reverseText()) // Output: olleH
```

# 6.Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming

# Question:
What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Java and Kotlin?

# Answer:
- **Synchronous Programming:**
  - Code runs in sequence, blocking further execution until the current task finishes.
  
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Allows other operations to execute while waiting for a task to complete.
  - In Kotlin, coroutines simplify asynchronous programming compared to Javaâ€™s threading model.


# 7. Kotlin Null Safety

## Question:
How does Kotlin ensure null safety?

## Answer:
- Kotlin enforces null safety by default, preventing `NullPointerException`.
- Variables are non-nullable unless explicitly marked with a `?` (e.g., `String?`).


val name: String? = null
println(name?.length) // Safe call


## 8. What is a Coroutine in Kotlin
## Question:
What is a coroutine in Kotlin?

## Answer:
- A coroutine is Kotlin's lightweight thread for asynchronous programming.
- They can suspend and resume execution without blocking the main thread.

# 9. Multithreading in Java
# Question:
How do you handle multithreading in Java?
# Answer:
- In Java, you can create a new thread by extending Thread or implementing Runnable.

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is running");
    }
}

Thread thread = new Thread(new MyTask());
thread.start();
```
