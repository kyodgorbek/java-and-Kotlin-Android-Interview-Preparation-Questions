In this post, we'll cover common Java and Kotlin interview questions and provide answers to help you prepare for technical interviews, especially if you're applying for Android development roles. Whether you're focusing on backend services or mobile app development, these questions touch on key areas like OOP, memory management, multithreading, coroutines, and Kotlin-specific features.
2. What is the Difference Between an Interface and an Abstract Class in Java?
Answer:
Interface: All methods are abstract (until Java 8+, which introduced default methods). Interfaces can be implemented by multiple classes, enabling multiple inheritance.

Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods. A class can only inherit from one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

3. What is the Purpose of Kotlin's val and var?
Answer:
val: Declares a read-only variable (equivalent to final in Java). Its value cannot be reassigned after initialization.

var: Declares a mutable variable whose value can be changed after initialization.

Example:
val name = "John" // Immutable
var age = 30      // Mutable
4. How Does Java Handle Memory Management?
Answer:
Java uses automatic memory management with Garbage Collection (GC). It tracks and frees up memory used by objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks. The Heap memory is where objects are stored, while Stack memory stores references to these objects.
5. What are Kotlin's Extension Functions?
Answer:
Extension functions allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying them. You can extend a class with new methods as if they were part of the class.
Example:
fun String.reverseText(): String {
    return this.reversed()
}

val original = "Hello"
println(original.reverseText()) // Output: olleH
6. What is the Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming in Java and Kotlin?
Answer:
Synchronous Programming: Operations run in a single thread. The code executes in sequence, blocking further execution until the current operation completes.

Asynchronous Programming: Code is executed in a non-blocking manner, allowing other operations to continue while waiting for a long-running task to finish.

In Kotlin, coroutines are used for asynchronous programming, providing a simpler and more efficient alternative to Java's threads.
7. How Does Kotlin Ensure Null Safety?
Answer:
Kotlin has a built-in null safety mechanism to prevent NullPointerException errors, which are common in Java. Variables in Kotlin are non-nullable by default. If a variable can be null, you must explicitly declare it with a nullable type (e.g., String?).
val name: String? = null
println(name?.length) // Safe call, returns null if 'name' is null
8. What is a Coroutine in Kotlin?
Answer:
A coroutine is Kotlin's solution for asynchronous programming. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a sequential style. Coroutines are lightweight threads that can suspend and resume execution without blocking the thread.
Example using launch and async
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val job = launch {
        // Background task
    }
    val result = async {
        // Task returning a result
        "Hello, Coroutines!"
    }
    println(result.await())
}
9. How Do You Handle Multithreading in Java?
Answer:
In Java, multithreading is handled using either the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. You can create multiple threads and run them concurrently, but Java threads can be expensive in terms of memory.
Example:
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is running");
    }
}

Thread thread = new Thread(new MyTask());
thread.start();
10. What is the Difference Between launch and async in Kotlin Coroutines?
Answer:
launch: Starts a coroutine and doesn't return a result. It is mainly used when you want to fire and forget a task.

async: Starts a coroutine that returns a result through a Deferred object. You use await() to get the result.

val job = launch { 
    // Does not return a result
}

val deferred = async {
    // Returns a result
    "Hello"
}

println(deferred.await()) // Prints "Hello"
11. What is the Purpose of the suspend Function in Kotlin?
Answer:
A suspend function can be paused and resumed later, without blocking the main thread. It is used inside coroutines to perform long-running tasks without freezing the UI.
Example
suspend fun fetchData() {
    delay(1000) // Suspend function that delays coroutine for 1 second
    println("Data fetched")
}
12. How Does Kotlin Handle Interoperability with Java?
Answer:
Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can call Java code from Kotlin and vice versa. Kotlin compiles to Java bytecode, making it compatible with existing Java libraries.
To call Java code in Kotlin:
val list = ArrayList<String>() // Java's ArrayList
list.add("Hello")
To call Kotlin from Java:
KotlinClass.ktFunction();
Conclusion
By preparing for questions like these, you'll be ready to tackle the Java and Kotlin sections of your interview, whether for Android development or backend systems. Both languages share similarities but also have distinct features like Kotlin's null safety and coroutines, which simplify asynchronous programming. Understanding these differences will help you stand out as a strong candidate in technical interviews.
